                In her free time, Edna enjoys indulging her love of reading and writing. She is a talented writer with a vivid imagination and a way with words. When she's not lost in a good book or working on her latest writing project, Edna can often be found curled up on the couch with a movie. As an indoors person, she enjoys nothing more than spending a quiet evening at home with a good film.
