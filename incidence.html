				Exactly a year ago, we went out, to the beach!<br />
				We went from afternoon to dawn!<br />
				I went there today. Guess what?!<br />
				I know that perfume now.<br />
				I passed by a gentleman who smelled just like you, well I dont know if you still 
				smell that way, maybe you changed it because you changed me for another.<br />
				I ran back to him to ask him of his perfume.<br />
				Intriguing I guess?
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I remember how we sat, on the shores.<br />
				I faced you sitting on your laps with my head laying in your chest.<br />
				I smelt you for hours, you refused to tell me what perfume it was 
				because you said it wouldn't be beautiful to Me anymore.<br />
				You also said I could get it anytime and would mind to 
				see you just to smell you cos I had your smell with me.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I got home  at 3 am, got my dress off and smelled you till day break.<br />
				Today, I got back without your smell to smell but I know it now.<br />
				I want to buy the perfume, not to smell you, but for the memories!
